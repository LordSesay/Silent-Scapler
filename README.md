## 📌 What Problem Are We Solving?

Serverless applications often suffer from:

- **Manual deployment processes** lacking automation
- **Configuration drift** without infrastructure-as-code
- **No visibility** into build → deploy stages
- **Difficulty in maintaining consistency across environments**

**Serverless DevOps Pipeline** addresses these issues by combining GitHub Actions, Terraform, and AWS services into a secure, automated CI/CD pipeline for Lambda-based applications.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Deploy AWS Lambda functions automatically via CI/CD
- Use GitHub Actions to handle build, test, and deploy stages
- Define infrastructure using Terraform for reproducibility
- Ensure consistency, security, and scalability in a fully serverless environment

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Tool/Service           | Role                                                      |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **AWS Lambda**         | Serverless compute for business logic                     |
| **API Gateway**        | HTTP interface for Lambda functions                       |
| **GitHub Actions**     | CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy serverless apps        |
| **Terraform**          | Provision Lambda, API Gateway, IAM roles, etc.            |
| **Amazon S3**          | (Optional) For storing build artifacts or frontend code   |
| **IAM**                | Secure access and permission control                      |

## 🔁 How It Works

1. **Code pushed to GitHub** triggers GitHub Actions
2. **GitHub Actions** builds and packages Lambda function
3. **Terraform** applies infrastructure (Lambda + API Gateway)
4. **Deployment artifacts** (ZIP or config) are uploaded to S3 (if used)
5. **Lambda endpoint** is updated and ready to serve traffic

## 💼 Business Use Case

A startup wants to ship new features rapidly without managing servers.  
By combining GitHub Actions and AWS Lambda, this pipeline automates deployments with no manual steps, enabling faster releases and more developer focus.

---

## 📈 Business Value

- **Rapid Releases:** Code → production in minutes
- **Low Cost:** No idle compute or persistent infrastructure
- **Security:** IAM-based access control and CI secrets
- **Consistency:** All infra and logic defined in Git and Terraform
- **Developer Velocity:** One-click deployment workflow via GitHub

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add staging/production environment separation
- [ ] Integrate with CodeQL or SonarCloud for security scanning
- [ ] Add automated API tests post-deployment
- [ ] Monitor Lambda metrics in CloudWatch
